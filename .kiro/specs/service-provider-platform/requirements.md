# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive web application for a service provider platform. The application will consume an existing REST API to enable service providers to offer their services and clients to book and pay for these services. The platform includes user authentication, service management, booking functionality, transaction history, and balance management with role-based access control.

## Requirements

4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token in local storage or global state
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

7. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the stored token and redirect to login page

### Requirement 2: User Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register as either a client or service provider, so that I can access the platform with the appropriate role.
